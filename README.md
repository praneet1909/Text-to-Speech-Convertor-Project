# Text-to-Speech-Convertor-Project
(Web Project)

A Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter is a technology that converts written text into spoken words using synthetic speech. It is widely used in applications such as virtual assistants, screen readers for the visually impaired, language learning tools, and interactive voice response systems. The TTS system takes input text, processes it using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and generates audio output that sounds like human speech. Modern TTS systems aim for high-quality, natural-sounding voices that can mimic emotions, accents, and intonations.
This technology enhances accessibility, user interaction, and automation in various fields, making it an essential component in todayâ€™s digital world.
